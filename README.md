## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Git

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stage.git
   cd stage
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables** (optional)

   Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   # Optional: Cloudinary Configuration (for image optimization)
   NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
   CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your-api-key
   CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your-api-secret

   # Optional: Screenshot API (for website screenshots)
   SCREENSHOTAPI_KEY=your-screenshot-api-key
   ```

   > **Note**: The app works completely without these environment variables. All core features including **export work fully in-browser**. Cloudinary is only used for optional image optimization of backgrounds and overlays.

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

5. **Open your browser**

   Navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## 🏗️ Architecture

Stage is a **fully in-browser canvas editor** that requires no external services for core functionality.

### Export Pipeline (100% Client-Side)

Stage uses a pure canvas rendering approach with complete in-browser processing:

- **Background Layer** - Gradients, solid colors, and images rendered in Konva
- **User Image Layer** - Main image rendered in Konva Stage with precise positioning
- **Overlay Layer** - Text and image overlays rendered directly in Konva
- **3D Transform Layer** - CSS 3D transforms captured with modern-screenshot as HTML fallback

The export pipeline composites these layers client-side in the correct order to produce high-quality output without any server or external API calls.

### Optional Services

- **Cloudinary** - Used only for image optimization when configured (completely optional)
- **Screenshot API** - Used only for website screenshot capture feature (optional)
